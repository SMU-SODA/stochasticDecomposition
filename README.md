# Stochastic Decomposition 

Stochastic decomposition (SD) is a sequential sampling-based algorithm for two-stage stochastic linear programs (2-SLP). The algorithmic details can be found in:

This software is developed by Jason Mai, Lei Zhao, Yifan Liu, and Harsha Gangammanavar and Suvrajeet Sen.

### Support
Please report bugs [here on GitHub](https://github.com/SMU-SODA/stochasticDecomposition/issues).

## Version information: 
`v1.0`: Supports 2-SLPs with randomness in right-hand side and the technology matrix.  
`v2.0`: Supports 2-SLPs with randomness in right-hand side vector, the technology matrix and cost coefficient vector.

## Input file format
The implementation of accepts stochastic programs described using the SMPS file format:

* Core file: Describes the optimization problem corresponding to a single scenario
* Time file: Provides information regarding decomposition of the problem into master and subproblem
* Stoch file: Describes the stochastic information associated with the problem. (Currently, INDEP and BLOCK types are supported)

For more information about the SMPS file format [here](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898718799.ch2)

## Installation
Note: Only Unix systems have been tested.
#### Prerequisite: 
  * CPLEX should be available on your machine. Trial version is available [here](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/).
  * Git, if you want to directly use the commands below.
  * This repository uses certain utilities and data sets from the `spAlgorithms` respository. 

#### Steps
  1. Download the SD source codes.  
    * `git clone https://github.com/SMU-SODA/stochasticDecomposition.git`  
  2. For `v1.0`  
    * Checkout the version with: `git checkout v1.0`  
    * Follow instructions in the README file.  
  3. For `v2.0`  
    * Change into source directory: `cd SD`  
    * Check the `makefile` to make sure that the cplex installation directory is correct for your system.  
    * Compile the code: `make all`  
  4. Setup a directory to write output files.  
    * `mkdir spOutput`  
  5. Execute the algorithm. The input options for the algorithm are:  
         Input options:  
             `-p` string  -> problem name.  
             `-i` string  -> input directory where the problem SMPS files are saved.  
             `-o` string  -> output directory where the result files will be written.  
             `-e` {0,1}   -> evaluation flag which determines if the final solution will be evaluated through out of sample evalauation.  
             `-d` {0,1}   -> use the dual stability test.  
             `-t` {l,n,t} -> tolerance level to be employed.  
                        Suggested tolerance(EPSILON, SCAN_LEN) = 'l'oose (0.01, 128), 'n'omimal (0.001, 256) and 't'ight (0.0001, 512)  
             `-m` {0,1}   -> use multiple replication.  
             `-c` {0,1}   -> build and solve compromise problem.  
     * Example: `-p pgp2 -i ../../spAlgorithms/spInput/ -o ../../spOutput -e 0 -d 1 -t l -m 0 -c 0`  

A collection of classical 2-SLP problems are included in the `spInput` folder of `spAlgorithms` repository. Results will be stored in `spOutput/problem_name` folder. Please check `pgp2.detailed_soln.out` for solutions and `time_sample.out` for CPU time and number of samples used.
